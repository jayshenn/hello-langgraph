Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to let you know that I am unable to attend the meeting scheduled for 10 AM at Canary Wharf. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I will not be able to join.

However, I would be available to meet at 12 PM the following day in New York. I hope this alternative works for you.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and would appreciate it if you could share the meeting highlights or any materials with me.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Vaibhav
